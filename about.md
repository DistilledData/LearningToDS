# LearningToDS
Jupyter notebook study guides for introductory data science topics. <br>
Disclaimers:
1. The notebooks presented here are study guide meant to supplement (**not replace**) a rigorous data science curriculum
2. The level of difficulty for these notebooks is aimed to fall somewhere between high-school super nerd and data science university drop out.
3. Although neural networks and related topics like NLP, energy-based models and computer vision are the newest cool kid on the block and are very interesting, the topic of neural networks and deep learning is rather advanced and falls outside the scope of these study guides. Therefore, I will most likely not be creating notebooks that cover DL or more advanced topics (at least for this particular repo).

# Suggested Notebook Order
The study guides are designed to build on one another, especially those notebooks within a particular topic. The suggested reading order shown below is meant to provide the greatest coherence. <br>
Furthermore the notebooks are grouped into directories based on topic for better organization.

## Probability
Probability knowledge is foundational to data science and is required before one can fully appreciate the statistics and statistical models used in data science.
1. Probability_Basics
2. Probability_Basics_II
3. Probability_Basics_III
4. Common_Probability_Distributions
5. Intermediate_Probability

## Statistics
Often called the inverse of probability, statistical understanding is required before one starts biting into the juicy statistical models.

## Supervised Learning Models
These are common models that are used in the wild for supervised learning tasks.
1. Classification_Basics
2. Classification_with_Logistic_Regression
