Jupyter notebook study guides for introductory data science topics.

Disclaimers:
1. The notebooks presented here are study guide meant to supplement (**not replace**) a rigorous data science curriculum
2. The level of difficulty for these notebooks is aimed to fall somewhere between high-school super nerd and data science university drop out.
3. Deep learning and related topics will be added at a later time in a different repo

## Suggested Notebook Order
The study guides are designed to build on one another, especially those notebooks within a particular topic. The suggested reading order shown below is meant to provide the greatest coherence.

Furthermore the notebooks are grouped into directories based on topic for better organization.

### Probability
Probability knowledge is foundational to data science and is required before one can fully appreciate the statistics and statistical models used in data science.
1. [Probability Basics](http://distilleddata.me/LearningToDS/Probability_Basics.html)
2. [Probability Basics II](http://distilleddata.me/LearningToDS/Probability_Basics_II.html)
3. [Probability Basics III](http://distilleddata.me/LearningToDS/Probability_Basics_III.html)
4. [Common Probability Distributions: Discrete](http://distilleddata.me/LearningToDS/Common_Probability_Distributions_Discrete.html)


### Statistics
Often called the inverse of probability, statistical understanding is required before one starts biting into the juicy statistical models.

### Supervised Learning Models
These are common models and techniques that are used in the wild for supervised learning tasks.
